1. Strategy and Implementation Decisions
For this application, I chose to use Python and Django, as suggested by the challenge. Additionally, I utilized the Pandas librarie to handle data since we are working with CSV files. I spent considerable time understanding the application structure and data flow because I care about organization and code quality. To achieve this, I followed several SOLID principles, such as Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, and Dependency Inversion.

Regarding design patterns, I adopted:

Repository Pattern: for data access, encapsulating all the logic for reading and manipulating the CSV
files.
Service Layer Pattern: to isolate the business logic, ensuring that the rules remain separate from the
presentation layer.
The overall architecture follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern, distributed as follows:

Model: Represented by the Legislator class.
View: Comprised of HTML templates.
Service: Implemented by the LegislativeService.

Data Processing Logic
The data processing logic followed these steps:

Load the Data: Read all the CSV files.
Mapping Votes: Create a map linking vote_id to bill_id.
Filter Votes: Filter the votes for a specific legislator.
Processing: For each vote by the legislator, count the number of support votes and opposition votes.
Update Object: Finally, update the legislator object with the computed counts.
This solution utilizes in-memory caching, meaning the data is loaded only once and then reused, which
improves performance.

2. Adapting for New Columns
The current implementation is designed to accommodate new CSV columns, such as "Bill Voted On Date" or
"Co-Sponsors." To achieve this:

In the Models Layer: 
Introduce a Bill class that contains the new attributes.

Within the Repository Pattern: 
The layer that handles data reading already manages dynamic columns, making it straightforward to add new fields.

In the Service Layer: 
Simply add new methods or adjust existing ones to perform analyses with the new information.

3. CSV Generation from Data
If the requirements change to that, instead of reading data from a CSV file, we are provided with a list of legislators or bills, the solution can be adapted as follows:

Modify the Repository Pattern: Add functionality to export the processed data to a CSV file.

Data Generation Service: Create an additional service that generates the data based on the provided input and saves it as a CSV file, maintaining consistency with the overall architecture.

4. Development Time
I dedicated approximately 8 hours to understanding, planning, and implementing the solution. This time included analyzing the requirements, designing the architecture, implementing the modules, and writing the necessary documentation.
